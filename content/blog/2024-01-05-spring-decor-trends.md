# Spring Decor Trends to Try This Year

As winter fades away, it's time to refresh our homes and embrace the energy of spring! Here are the top decorating trends I'm loving this season.

## 1. Earthy Green Tones

This year, we're moving beyond sage green to deeper, more complex earth tones. Think forest green, olive, and deep moss colors.

## 2. Natural Textures

Bringing the outdoors in is more popular than ever:
- Woven grass baskets
- Raw wood elements
- Stone and ceramic accessories
- Linen and hemp textiles

## 3. Curved Furniture

Soft, organic shapes are having a major moment. Look for:
- Round dining tables
- Curved sofas and chairs
- Organic-shaped mirrors
- Flowing light fixtures

## 4. Maximalist Gallery Walls

Gone are the days of minimalist art. This spring is all about:
- Layered artwork
- Mixed frame styles
- Personal photographs
- Vintage finds and prints

## 5. Sustainable Materials

Eco-consciousness is driving design choices:
- Reclaimed wood furniture
- Recycled glass accessories
- Vintage and antique pieces
- Locally-made ceramics

## How to Incorporate These Trends

You don't need to overhaul your entire home! Start small with accessories, textiles, or a single statement piece.
