# DIY Bathroom Closet Refresh: A Complete Guide

Every project starts with a single step, and this one was no different. My goal with this bathroom closet refresh was to create a space that felt intentional and custom-built, without spending a ton or hiring anyone to do it for me.

I made this guide for anyone who's ever looked at a DIY project and thought, "That looks too complicated." Trust me, it's completely doable. A little patience, some creativity, and a willingness to try can take you further than you think.

## Introduction

This project might look intimidating at first, but it's more straightforward than it appears. The beauty of a low-budget DIY like this is that you can take your time, experiment, and even make a few mistakes along the way without it costing a fortune.

I made plenty of mistakes while tackling this one, but each one taught me something new and helped me figure out better ways to do things. Don't be afraid to try, to put in a little extra effort, or to change direction if something doesn't go as planned.

The goal isn't perfection. It's creating something you're proud of, learning as you go, and enjoying the process.

So grab your tools, take a deep breath, and let's get started.

## Materials and Tools

You don't need a huge workshop or fancy equipment for this build. Here's what I used:

### Materials

* 1x2x8' Clear Select Pine Board
* 18G Finishing Brad Nails
* Spackling
* Foam Roller
* Sheetrock Joint Compound
* Paint

### Tools

* Circular Saw 
* Miter Saw / Miter Box
* Measuring Tape
* Brad Nailer (or Hammer and Nails)
* Sanding Block
* Paint Brush

**Tip:** If you don't already own everything, don't stress. Building up your toolkit happens project by project. Some tools feel like big purchases, but they pay for themselves over time. Hiring someone to do these smaller jobs often costs more than just investing in the tools yourself, and once you have them, they open the door to so many future projects.

## The Build

1. **Clear out the old closet system.** Start with a clean slate. Remove any existing shelves or rods and patch up holes so you're working with a smooth surface.

2. **Measure and cut your supports.** Decide on the depth and width of your new shelves. Cut your 1x2s to size, these will act as the supports that get screwed directly into the studs along the closet walls.

3. **Cut the shelf tops.** Measure and cut your plywood to fit. Don't worry about absolute perfection if you're painting; small gaps can be filled later with painter's caulk. If you're staining or sealing instead, take extra care with your cuts since caulk stands out more on natural wood and I wouldn't recommend using it too much.

4. **Attach the decorative trim.** Once the shelves are secured, add trim to the front edge using a nailer. This instantly gives the closet a more finished and polished look.

5. **Sand between steps.** After cutting, attaching, and filling, lightly sand as you go to keep everything smooth and even.

6. **Finish it off.** Apply your choice of paint, stain, or sealer. Once dry, you'll have a closet that looks custom-built and completely refreshed.

## Conclusion

Flipping a closet takes patience and a bit of trial and error, but the end result is so worth it. Don't worry if every cut or corner isn't perfect, handmade projects always have character, and that's what makes them special.

I hope this guide gives you the confidence to tackle your own bathroom closet refresh (or whatever project you've been putting off). Remember, we do hard things and we learn as we go.
