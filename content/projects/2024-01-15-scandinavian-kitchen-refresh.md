# Scandinavian Kitchen Refresh

Our kitchen needed a fresh perspective. While functional, it lacked the clean, serene aesthetic we craved. Drawing inspiration from Scandinavian design principles, we created a space that's both beautiful and highly functional.

## Design Principles

### Functionality First
Every element serves a purpose while contributing to the overall aesthetic.

### Natural Materials
We incorporated wood, stone, and other natural elements throughout.

### Clean Lines
Simple, uncluttered surfaces create a sense of calm.

### Light and Bright
Maximizing both natural and artificial light was key.

## The Transformation

### Before: The Challenges
- Cluttered countertops
- Dark upper cabinets
- Poor organization
- Lack of personality

### After: The Solutions
- Open shelving for display and storage
- Light paint colors throughout
- Organized systems for everything
- Carefully curated accessories

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Cabinet Refresh
Instead of replacing cabinets, we:
- Painted upper cabinets white
- Added new brushed brass hardware
- Removed some upper doors for open shelving

### 2. Color Scheme
- Warm white walls
- Natural wood accents
- Black and brass details
- Lots of greenery

### 3. Organization Systems
- Installed pull-out drawers
- Added drawer dividers
- Created zones for different activities
- Displayed everyday items beautifully

## The Results

Our kitchen now feels like a peaceful, efficient workspace that we actually enjoy spending time in. The Scandinavian influence brings calm to our busy mornings and makes cooking feel more intentional.
