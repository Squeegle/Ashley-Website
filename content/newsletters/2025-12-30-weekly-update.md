I'm so excited I finally got to reveal my daughter's new room with you last week! It was so hard keeping it a secret, but it was worth the wait. I'm beyond honored that I got to be part of the announcement for the HGTV Home by Sherwin-Williams 2026 Color Collection of the Year. Such a pinch me moment!

For the next few weeks, I'll be DIYing projects for my daughter's Halloween carnival fourth birthday party. Right now I'm in full-on craft mode making carnival games, and it's already looking so fun. Head to my stories if you want to follow along behind the scenes!

Thanks for being here, it really means the world to me!
